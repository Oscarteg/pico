# Pico ✏️

>Todos, notes, nothing fancy.

Pico is a more lightweight, ephemeral companion to my [Ligature](https://github.com/thesephist/polyx#ligature) notes application. While Ligature is designed to be a long-term archive of the most important notes in my life, Pico is for the more temporary notes -- the todos, the things I jot down between meetings, the thoughts I need to put somewhere before I triage them into a different document.

Pico is built with [Torus](https://github.com/thesephist/torus) as a fully client-side rendered application, with a minimal Go backend. You'll notice that the interface is extremely bare. Pico isn't really meant for other people to use, and is tailor-made specifically for my limited use case. The interface isn't user-friendly, but it works great for me.
