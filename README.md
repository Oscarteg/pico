Todos, notes, nothing fancy

A globally synchronized, timestamped, notepad that I'll use like how I'm using Markus now. This includes rolling the todo / todoist workflow I'm currently using this doc for.

- Dark / light theme for night vs. day, 8AM - 8PM
- Fork the backend of `mira`
- Debounced auto-save (check Codesynth for it)
- Preview should scroll smoothly with the authoring interface / input box.
- Ability to look back at the state of the document on date `$DATE`
    - There should be a UI to scroll back and look at the state of the doc on any past date.
- Flat, white background, Ideapad-like UI design, and Torus + Go backend.
- Unlike Ligature / Noct which are fixed, permanent tools that don't change, I want Pin to be easily changeable and constantly evolving. I want to be able to script / adopt it flexibly to my workflows. So not in the polyx repo, no Ink, etc.
